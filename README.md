### About the book
This book is more like a notebook for my personal and educational purposes. I prefer taking my notes in latex, and organize all of them in a booklike structure like this one you are reading right now. The book is open source and in public domain.

Majority of times, two books were used to study analysis:
*  Understanding Analysis - Stephen Abbot
*  Introduction to Real Analysis - Robert G. Bartle

Furthermore, other sources such as mathexchange, wikipedia, and university lecture notes are used generally. If a specific source is used, it is usually listed in the end of the chapter.


### How to use the book
I use this for fast fact checking purposes (that is what notes are for, right?).
