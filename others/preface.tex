\chapter*{Preface}
\section*{About the Book}
This book is more like a notebook for my personal and educational purposes. I prefer taking my notes in latex, and organize all of them in a booklike structure like this one you are reading right now. The book is open source and in public domain.
\section*{Book's source}
You may find the tex source files in my github account.
\section*{References}
Majority of times, two books were used to study analysis:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Understanding Analysis - Stephen Abbot
    \item  Introduction to Real Analysis - Robert G. Bartle
\end{enumerate}
Furthermore, other sources such as mathexchange, wikipedia, and university lecture notes are used generally. If a specific source is used, it is usually listed in the end of the chapter.
\section*{How to use the Book}
I use this for fast fact checking purposes (that is what notes are for, right?).
